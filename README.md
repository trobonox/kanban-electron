This software is intended for offline usage only, and saves all boards under a config.json file. As an online counterpart, you can use [Trello](https://trello.com) or my counterpart [Productivity Suite](https://productivity-suite-three.vercel.app) (Please note that this is currently a work in progress, so some features are still missing and you might encounter bugs).

Open for any contributions or feature requests, though always keep in mind that I am still a student with limited time and I might not be able to process every request immediately.

## ðŸ“‹ Roadmap (planned features)
* Custom themes (curated selection + editor to create your own from scratch)
* UI improvements like a bar for quick actions in the board view
* More card properties like a due date or sub-tasks
* Custom backgrounds in board view
* JSON exporting of boards
